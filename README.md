Use github as a log storage

# Usage

See `example`.

# Installation

Due to Netlify limits in total build time, this is not suitable for frequent
updates.

In order to avoid reach of the total build time limit, it is recommended to
[deactivate](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/stop-or-activate-builds/) automatic build of the project hosting the logs.
Anyway, deploying the logs may not be necessary at all, depending on use case.
